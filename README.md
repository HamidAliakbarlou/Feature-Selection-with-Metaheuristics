# Parallelization-with-Genetic-Algorithm
Parallelizing coding for feature selection process with Genetic Algorithm:

In this project, we offer a modern metaheuristic methods for finding feasible solutions with a machine learning model (Support Vector Machine) for feature selection tasks: Simulated Annealing, Variable Neighborhood Search, and Genetic Algorithm. Finally, we summarise our findings and insights regarding the results through comparison and analysis.
